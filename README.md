# SimpleWeakestLink
**Simple weakest link page written last minute to keep score in the weakest link gameshow at our local Scouts group.**

## Usage
Goto https://7kasper.github.io/SimpleWeakestLink/.
Or load the html on your computer, the video file must be in the same directory to play properly.
Now the gamemaster can keep score like in the real WeakestLink using a few keyboard presses.

`v` - Question right, show the value of the next question.  
`c` - Question wrong, reset the current question.  
`f` - Back, goto the value of the previous question (for if you were triggerhappy)  
`b` - Bank. If player shouts bank, the value of the last answered  
`p` - Tripple Bank. For the second last round. Question value is multiplied by three before it is banked.   
`page reload` - resets the bank :wink:

_Note: The banked value is not to be confused with the displayed value of the next question. The amount in the bank is what the players get to own and is save from wrong answers, the value displayed above is just the worth of the next question. Upon banking the question worth is also reset of course._

## Voting out
When the weakest link is known from the voting round you can use `q` to play a silly doctor who video to irritate them.  
Use `w` to go back.
